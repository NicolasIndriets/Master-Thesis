Dear user,

Thanks for using the Atlas. 

For an optimal contrast we recommend you to use MRIcron (www.mricro.com) with the 00average_brain.nii we provide with the digital Atlas as a standard anatomical reference. 

Note that the NIH lookup table provides the best color code for a threshold range of [0.2; 1.1].

Best,
